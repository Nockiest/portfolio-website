            <h3>Javascript</h3>
            <p>The first time we got to code our own school canteneens website during our IT lesson, I fell in love with the world of computers. My website was nothing outstanding honestly, but it didn't discourage me. Now it is over a year and I have moved quite a lot on my journey to become a competent web dev.</p>

            <h3>Food Styling</h3>
            <p>As a runner, I have a great energy expenditure, which I have to compensate for using the contents of our fridge. Because it is hard to eat such quantities of food, I was forced by the circumstances to make some quality food. I am keeping up a breakfast channel, where I upload my breakfasts in weekly intervals.</p>

            <h3>Languages</h3>
            <p>I have a passion for learning languages. It always broadens my worldview and allows me to interact with more content, such as books, videos, or music. I can communicate in Czech, English, German, and a bit in French and Spanish. If you want to communicate with me through these languages, I am fine with it.</p>
